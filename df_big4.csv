I raised my hand and leaned in to every opportunity that came my way but was passed over 8 times in one year. After talking to other admin it can take 8 to 10 years to find a lateral role in another department. I was later told by a manager that Deloitte simple doesnt have a lot of advancement options. 
-There is a strict anti-bullying policy but if your a partner or well liked you can bully whomever you please.

-Dont bother complaining to your manager about anything. They are more interested in covering their butt then having your back. 
-Dont bother reporting to the hotline. While there is an anti-retaliation policy it apparently is not enforced. 
-You are told you can ""grow"" your career this appears to mean you will take on more work for the same title and same pay. 
-The environment is like being in high school instead of being part of a team. There was an admin that would walk behind my cube and peak over to see what I was doing and this is completely acceptable. 
-How well your liked determines what you can get away with. If I was 10 minutes late my manager would ping me but there were admin that would go to the gym at 10am or arrive anywhere between 9 and 11 then leave between 3 and 4. 
-There are no yearly reviews or bonuses. You are told you are a number and replaceable. Since you cost more then your bring in there is no effort to grow you. 
-Admin come in at a level 3 with no option to advance but level 4 and above have the option to have mentors, take advancement classes and be part of special projects. 
-They preach a lot of diversity and inclusion. There is an inclusion council but you have to be recommended by a current member then voted in. 85% of partners are white males. There used to be inclusion groups for cultures but it was too much of a hassle and they were dissolved.
-Your time is not respected. You are expected to be available at all hours of the day and night. If you point out that you entitled to off time as well your job description will be printed for you so you can review what your responsibilities are.

Verbal/emotional abuse - happens day to day if you work under a certain notorious partner in the insurance practice
Favoritism - certain individuals are propped up and allowed to pick projects of their choosing. The rest are tossed onto long engagements with no career growth. Speaking up by asking to roll off will only destroy your career.

1) There's no place for skill. Even if you dont have skill to work you can still survive.
2)Your designation matters in every aspect. Be it decision making in any aspect( appraisal, judgment, biased feeling and even gossip) your position matters. The higher your level is the easier it to delegate/escape from responsibility and to do false claims.
3)Constant micromanagement. I repeat constant, you do get mails kind of ordering you to work from assigned desk so as to have a constant monitor on your progress. This will result in distrust towards leadership
4)WFH policies are a joke. You need to seek permission for WFH explaining a valid reason else it will be rejected.
5) Forget about Work life balance. You have to say yes to whatever the onsite team(US) asks.
6) An elaborated procedure to build your year's performance. Yet in the end you will get a good appraisal ,even after all the hard work, only if leadership feels like (totally biased).",1,3

More focus on the individual's profile rather than it's knowledge.

Management communicates in a way that will bring the individual to a position unprofessional and unethical for discussion; apart from this management might try to make promises which cannot be fulfilled.
Management seems uncoordinated.
It is never clear who is the person in charge at company level, people will always avoid the responsibilities.

They gave a few hours to resign with 2 months’ pay or threatened to terminate without any pay-out. Many employers laid off during the pandemic but gave 3 or 6 or 9 some even 12 months’ pay. Some gave additional pay based on number of years served with the company. 6 years with company means 6 months additional pay + severance pay package.

A company's ethics are best evaluated in crisis. It was unethical on Deloitte's part to lay off without appropriate pay-outs.

For face saving they hired a handful and did propaganda everywhere to portray an image that they're hiring instead of firing as others.

Now the other ""CONS""

1. The new appraisal & performance evaluation system is a sham & lacks transparency. Manager is GOD. 
There's no concrete grievance mechanism. Snapshot based on few questions might work for non-technical teams but certainly not for technical teams. The person answering those questions should be competent enough to understand the true meaning of those questions in the first place.

If your counsellor sleeps throughout the year & wakes up at the 11th hour you're doomed. Likely to be fired.

2. Hire & Fire policy. Deloitte is heavily invested in PR and branding, if they hire 10 folks, they will announce it all over but quietly layoff 1000 without a whisper.

3. Don't fall for the HR propaganda of Employee wellbeing, Mental health & ""Our people are our asset"". It's nothing but high decibel propaganda. When push comes to shove, they are best in the business with slaughtering ""Human"" resources inhumanely.

4. Gone are the days when Deloitte offered better pay packages. Venture out and you are likely to be paid much better.

5. Firm Initiatives - It's a good concept but blatantly misused and exploited. In Deloitte employees are expected to go and over beyond their project deliverables by doing firm initiatives for which more often than not employees are expected to network with higher ups. This is where the blatant exploitation occurs. Nepotism, Favouritism, Boot Lickism, add any ""isms"" you want to add. For someone who is not good at these qualities should definitely avoid Deloitte. In US firm initiative concept is not so much exploited but in India is hopeless. Ideas are stolen & given to favourite people at times.

6. ""Glass Ceiling"" - After a certain career level if you don't have the blessings of multiple ""GODS"" in the so-called leadership, it is impossible to survive & break the glass ceiling and go beyond a certain level. Manager & above specially.

7. Learning - The learnings are limited as most of Deloitte projects do not require hi fi tech skills. But they do provide avenues like Udemy and others to employees to upskill at their leisure.

8. The annual appraisal results are announced in May and hikes are rolled out in September thus delaying the whole cycle by 6 months. This is ridiculous which makes it tricky to plan your next potential jump & leaves a very small window considering employers demand last 3 months salary so 1 would want to show hiked up salary slips.

9. Work Culture - Its going downhill recklessly fast as the hiring at higher levels from other organizations have ruined the original ""Deloitte"" culture

10. Work life balance - It's difficult to maintain work life balance while working for Deloitte as apart from project work one has to slog for firm initiative hours which more often than not decides the rating, hike and bonus. Because people who screw on projects are fired anyways. So hardly anyone screws on their project.

11. Reward system - Rewards are exploited by managers blatantly and distributed many times to boot lickers or favourites. But this is not across the board. Many a deserving people also are awarded. But there is no checks and balances system. Also, one can work round the clock and put in all the efforts and still go unnoticed and unrewarded.",0,5

If you're a recent college graduate, I'm sure you'd learn a lot (although that could be said about most kids who enter the workforce with their first or second job).","Deloitte - like many consulting firms - use a ""churn and burn"" business model. Deloitte is successful because most employees do not stay for more than 3 years and are replaced with new hires who are cheaper and are willing to drink the Kool Aid. 

Deloitte is especially predatory with experienced hires. Their pitch, essentially, is: 1. You'll be hired to perform at your level of experience (false, Deloitte promotes from within and preference is given to those that have been there the longest/have the best connections); 2. You'll be promoted quickly (false, you'll constantly be disappointed by the structural bureaucracy that is designed to keep people as long as is tenable in the lowest paid position - their starting salary). 

The single most important negotiation you'll have at Deloitte is when you receive an offer letter with their lowball salary. If you're disappointed with your base salary or whatever you negotiate, you're essentially guaranteed to be disappointed during your entire tenure. Those who are promoted are only given the minimum within the pay-band for their level and aren't eligible for a bonus at the time of promotion. (There are other very real systems in place that keep your promoted salary below - trust me, unless you're 23 and never had a real job, you'll be infuriated by your new salary at promotion). 

Ask yourself how Deloitte can be profitable with massive overhead (their answer to low salary levels is that ""we invest in you"" with happy hours and trainings) and an ever evolving offerings in the marketplace (ie dubious client ROIs that are grossly overpriced)? The answer is that their business model (like most consulting firms and law firms) is to keep talent costs low and the PPMDs (Principals, Partners, and Managing Directors) skim their contracts, while providing little-to-no value add. 

I would recommend Deloitte or any of the Big 4 to recent college graduates as you'll learn a lot and can then leave for a better salary and more responsibilities. Experienced hires are the real suckers at a place like Deloitte and I would strongly discourage taking a position, unless you negotiate a competitive salary.",0,1

The starting salary of an Analyst seems like a lot when you sign the contract, but it quickly evaporates if you are not budgeting. Saving/investing your money and maintaining a low key lifestyle your first 2 years will allow you to make a decision about your future at the firm after your first promotion w/o money being a factor. This is true freedom

-Lots of learning opportunities (courses, certifications, etc.) that they'll pay for

-Exposure to different industries and skillsets are a great way to prototype your interests before investing in a Masters or jumping into a more specific career path/industry","TL;DR The firm's politics take priority over efficiency making it unsustainable to start a career here and stay.

Middle-level management and upwards typically did not ""grow up"" in the firm (start their career with Deloitte), so they think that anyone who is starting their career with such a ""great name"" should shutup and appreciate what they have. These folks likely hit the consulting revolving door amongst competitors (Accenture, Booz, EY, etc.) or came from smaller firms. I really don't want to care where someone was previously. If they're a great leader and a great teammate then the labeling should not matter. But that's just it. The labeling matters to these types of leaders and their pervasive attitude about the Deloitte name makes its way down to all levels of practitioners. Deloitte has a good reputation, but we must continually work to earn that reputation day in and day out - not coast on the idea that we're great just because we're too big to fail.

Instead of focusing on the transformational aspects of building a team and serving clients, these types of leaders focus on the transactional aspects of promotion, salary, and exposure to leadership. These cultural cons trickle into every aspect of the firm - making it unsustainable for someone who values the ability to create impact, solve problems creatively, and have more autonomy over our time to stay with the firm past 2-4 years. This creates a vacuum of leadership as most who start with the firm exit before reaching management (and thus the cycle perpetuates as management is sourced from people who did not grow up in the firm).",1,1

I did not get a sense of direction or strategy from the partners and directors that I worked for. Actual billable work was low, resulting in horse trading with other business units where I was used as a resource for their projects. This would be fine if it was short term but this would prove to be the reality for the vast majority of my time at Deloitte.

The stakeholders of this business unit were not employee focused either. While they were never rude or unfriendly, they took no interest in their employees. Whenever they came into town (most were based out of different cities), they would not even drop by to greet my colleagues and I. It was not uncommon to watch them walk directly past me. Even when seated directly behind me, they would not even acknowledge me or say 'hello'. I initiated the greetings the first few times but seeing that this was never ever reciprocated, I can only assume they were not interested in speaking to me and stopped.

After working there for a year, I was informed of a 'raise' not by the partner of my business unit, but instead by a proxy, a partner from different business unit. And this 'raise', was for a rather insulting and disingenous amount of $1000 per annum.

When I put in my resignation letter, I was asked me a rather bizarre question: ""Do you want me to ask you to stay?"". He only asked me why I was leaving a day later when he was completing some paper work where the reason for my departure was needed.",0,1

Nice to have in your resume (though employee turnover is high). 

Possibility of learning a lot of things (though not guaranteed).

Very nice offices (though overcrowded, with plans to double/triple staff within the same space).","Very poor and in many cases almost insulting salaries. Generally 15% to 30% less than the average in the region, depending on experience. Even though there is (the possibility of) an annual bonus, the amount given is not nearly enough to compensate for that difference. 

Promotion criteria are questionable. People commonly end up using job offers as leverage for a minuscule raise. 

Non-flexible 9-6 work schedule is a joke, especially when it comes to a software-related position! The typical overtime will leave you starting your personal life at night.

Off-work assignments are frequent, requests to work on public holidays and weekends are also there. No incentive is given for any kind of extra effort (requested or voluntary). 

Requesting days off and expense refunds is a nightmare. Organizing business trips is even worse. Days off, even ones requested early, are not always guaranteed up until the last moment. 

Daily work routine is often disrupted by bureaucracy and random organizational barriers. 

Many projects are merely tedious chores and may well lead to damaging your career. 

Skills are of little significance when it comes to project staffing. There's a huge technical know-how gap across seniority levels, as people flee on the 2-year mark. Most effort is carried out by juniors/young graduates who are given responsibilities 2 to 3 levels above their pay grade. Burnout and plans for the next career step are common amongst many.

- Generous expense policy (not applicable during covid)
- Great support for travel (i.e. hotlines, etc.) (not applicable during covid)
- Great opportunities to gain experience if you're eager and direct with what you can and can't do
- Great networking opportunities. You can build a great network that will provide you a number of better job opportunities outside of Deloitte when they eventually leave
- I've met some of the closest friends and mentors here
- I've met people from all different types of backgrounds and stories. Some are Ivy league MBA graduates and others didn't even earn there college degrees","- Tremendous amounts of politics 
- Awful WLB. Your leadership always expects you to perform at the next level. The norm here is to perform at a level higher than you're getting paid...think about that.
- Your ""network"" determines how successful you are here. Make sure you have a coach that supports you and a team that is solid
- You can easily fall into a bad network where you have abusive leadership that will keep you around and decide your next projects 
- Heavy reliance on offshore teams. While some offshore teams are solid, I think it introduces a lot of risk of things falling through the cracks and generally makes WLB awful
- Not exciting compensation growth opportunities. Unless you boomerang or threaten to leave and have a solid offer to back it up, you can perpetually be stuck in a ""low"" pay band
- Sometimes you'll have projects staffed with people who don't have hands-on experience with the product, but a similar one instead. This is frustrating for obvious reasons. Not every product is the same.
- The amount of time it takes for Promo cycles and paycheck increases to kick in is absurd. After the performance year, it takes an additional 6 months of reviews before your title, compensation and bonus kick in. Think about that, working a total of 18 months before you actually see your bonus or promo...
- High turnover. Consulting is obviously not for everyone, but that makes it insanely difficult to build a strong network. In 3 years of working here, 80% of the people in my network have left already
- The culture can be exhausting if you have a network that is super Type A and insists on working around the clock
- If you're not traveling, all of the good things about consulting pretty much go out the window",0,3

Promotion is a pain. Their entire appraisal revolves around making connections with managers and senior managers which basically leads to a lot of internal politics. They make you work extra in the year leading to promotion and may not necessarily promote you even if you did well as they can make you work harder the next year as well. 
Despite making a massive profit before covid and even during covid, they fired a lot of employees, gave all of us paycuts and variable pay is not given. They made the most out of it.
If you are a Senior, you have to work on initiatives over and above project work to get good rating. It basically means you work late nights or the weekends. They are not optional and come with real targets and end dates.
You are required to be compliant with a 1000 rules on a weekly basis and chances are you will miss them couples of times a year. This affects appraisal obviously.
Deloitte has a lot of crappy projects. Your career will go down the drain if you stay too long in those projects. To be fair, maybe other companies has it too.

- Diversity only in appearances. Most people promoted at top levels might look different but think & talk a certain way. So the diversity is more of a facade and not genuine
- Some partners can be terrible to work for but you have the opportunity to walk away from those projects
- People at the leadership level aren't impressive or smart or inspiring
- A lot of talk about innovation but miles behind when it comes to innovation

Leadership expects you to operate as a professional with a shoestring budget for staffing. They don't have nearly enough staff to do the basic functions of the job, but when you can't keep your work afloat in 70+ hour weeks, they tell you that you don't know how to prioritize or you aren't putting out *fill in the level* work. Leadership believes the way to resolve this is to have more happy hour and zoom chat activities which are attended by just a few. Employees are suffering with mental health issues and extreme exhaustion due to the pressure, long hours, and lack of balance. Deloitte doesn't like using ""work/life balance,"" trading that instead for ""work/life integration,"" because they want you to integrate your work into your personal time. Self preservation is frowned upon in action, but they'll tell you how important wellness is to the company. They tell you to take your PTO, but good luck trying to find someone to cover you when you're out. Management says all the right things while also saying all the wrong things. Because they talk out of both sides of their mouths, employees are left confused, gaslit, and invalidated. That's how they skirt any real accountability for their behavior.",0,1

I think it’s a great place for anyone early in their career to get a big name on their resume and get lots of projects and experience under their belt.","The pay is not competitive for the field and area.

The recruiters are crafty liars. They tell people the level given will be based on experience, then give them a level 4, which they don’t mention is actually the LOWEST level despite sounding mid-level. They claim you can get bonuses at the end of the year, but don’t mention level 4s are not eligible for bonuses.

The levels seem to be partly based on your gender - multiple women were a level way below their actual skill level and multiple men were leveled too high. They know it - management would discuss the problem, but then claim they just couldn’t fix it. They still expect you to work at your actual skill level, not the lower one they hired you at. When they do promote you to a higher level, the salary increase is barely enough to match inflation.

Work-life balance is sometimes not ideal, but not atypical for consulting.",0,3

They changed the offer to spot offer after placing us thereby making sure that we wouldn't sit for any other company. They had first promised us internships but took them out of the offer at the last minute.

The package we got was pretty bad as well. For some verticals, you're stuck with the same salary for 3+ years before you can climb up the ladder.

They didn't give me my location of choice and I had to wait for one whole year before I could get relocated to the city of my choice. 

For freshers coming from campus placements, they don't consider your career aspirations into consideration and randomly assign you a technology line and there's literally no way of changing it.

Now coming to the actual work:
1. There is a huge bench and employees aren't adequately staffed into projects
2. Freshers are given a very rigorous 30-day training at the start of the job but are given very basic work once they're assigned to projects, like documentation, and it just might happen that by the time you have to start working on the technology, you won't really remember anything since it's been so long since you have actually practiced anything that you have to go through the training all by yourself
3. The work hours are very long and the work is very demanding. There are very few seniors who actually groom the freshers on-the-job so you're kind of left on your own to catch up - which can become overwhelming
4. The culture is pretty toxic. Nobody really cares about the other person in the team and there's a lot of politics among the leadership that affects literally everyone working under them. There are a lot of office relationships that hamper your work relationships.",0,1

3) No meaningful feedback on performance. The team is super big in size and working on minimal profits, so more than skills, bureacracy works in getting appraisals. Not writing from a bitter space, was promoted in the very first year.
4) Shift work. People continue working in shifts for years at end, without any improvement, leaving them choice to quit the firm. Very high attrition rate.
5) Very limited budget for trainings. 
6) Employee Wellbeing is non-existent at the ground level.

You're dreaming if you're expecting to grow financially with them...

You will be expected to do a LOT beyond your customer engagement (up to 20 hours a week and sometimes more) with very little recognition. The joke is that you will hear a lot of music about work life balance...

Huge focus on a single subjectively negative appraisal over 10s of positive client recognized impacts. This will also impact your promotion and salary increase, if it ever happen (hope you will not be shocked with 50£ and 100£ hikes)

If you have an alternative offer, please do not overvalue Deloitte as a brand or company. Never take their offer if it's not better than the competition as you will be squeezed for every single penny you will be getting.

Be very careful with the HR and recruitment team, they are expert MANIPULATORS. They will put every pressure on you to make you feel like you will be losing a lot by no immediately accepting an offer that is not aligned with what you want. The recruitment process might take 9-12 months and they will almost seem to be proud of it, but they will ask you to think over a scrap offer overnight hinting that they have a lot of applicants waiting for the role...

Not aligned to what other consultancies do, You will be expected to pay you lunch, drinks and coffees even if you are travelling to the south pole to deliver a client project.

Don't expect to have the right support to grow. You will be thrown in the middle of the pacific and expected to reach California by yourself. Very poor coaching and average/limited training offering.

Few of my colleagues reported that they have seen a last minute change to the offer bringing the salary and the grade to lower levels while they have been promised that they will be able to get it back in 1 year and as you might be thinking: Dream on; no one of them have been able to get what he expected in day 1 after the 1st year. I came to infer that this is some sort of practice to source high caliber profiler for lower salaries, get them into clients for very high rates (sometime 2 grades higher) while they will never feel that on their salary, promotion or even recognition.

The partners generally appear to hate one another, and treat each other as rivals. One in particular suffers obvious symptoms of mental disturbance, most likely narcissistic personality disorder. (Example: Her standard engagement letter actually includes braggadocio about her years as a Ph.D. student and her professional awards. What striking insecurity!) More generally, there is an endless rhetorical barrage about the importance of expressing honest disagreement and respect for diversity of opinion. That is nothing but institutional gaslighting.

- Brand recognition","- Ridiculously low wages and bonuses for the insanely long hours required
- Partners get very high disproportionate salaries compared with lower staff levels
- Management is incredibly dishonest and they only present events/figures/KPIs in ways that serve them. For example, EY deferred promotions in the UK to 'protect the business', but it is actually a disguised cost save as they know people won't leave their jobs during Covid-19 times 
- Even though EY increased revenue significantly and achieved ALL KPIs for FY20, it decided to defer promotions blaming Covid. This indicates that EY puts money over people and disguises cost savings as 'helping the business' which is very dishonest 
- Insanely bureaucratic and secretive, even simple requests need a large number of approvals and the business is super secretive about sharing any information with employees. Way too much time is spent on admin requirements
- Power and influence is highly concentrated in the hands of Partners and lower-level employees rarely have a say on things
- There is no culture of mentorship in the business. Managers and Senior Managers only want to exploit junior members during projects and discard them afterwards when they don't need them. Therefore, there is little support for mentorship and little altruism/empathy
- Since EY competes with other companies for projects, Partners and Directors discount projects singificantly to entice clients with attractive fees. However, 9/10 projects are dramatically under-staffed which means people work insanely long stresfull hours so that Partners/Directors can say they sold a lot of work to clients. Partners/Directors know this is the case and decide to screw people who execute projects even from the beginning through the way they structure projects. 
- Partners rarely talk to juniors and they often don't answer emails if you are not senior enough 
- Hiring policies are highly immoral as they try to get overqualified people to sign contracts for positions that are lower in rank than anywhere else in the market, therefore offering them lower wages than what they are worth
- HR sides with the business 10/10 cases and there is no impartiality, therefore HR can't be relied on at all
- A significant amount of travel is often required, therefore negatively work-life balance 
- IT is very poor, makes most projects a nightmare
- Diversity at senior levels is a joke. Aprox. 90% of senior leaders are White British males
- Moving across teams and functions is a highly opaque process which is also not encouraged. Therefore, lateral career progression is highly difficult
- Highly unethical behavior around clients. Often projects set fees for people for positions that are more senior than in actuality to charge clients higher fees
- EY uses its power as a large organisation to use and dump people on an ongoing basis. Leaders don't care about people leaving, it is business as usual for them and they don't even have a problem with that. Instead, they should understand why people leave and create a nurturing environment.
- Everyone is afraid to speak up to Partners or Clients, even when they have insanely unreasonable demands. EY is a fear-based culture.",1,3

In my time, i was thrown under the bus consistently only to be saved by really involved partners/executive level people who caught wind of what was going on and had to clear things up with the greater team. people who are ""up for promotion"" seem to do everything in their power to avoid any kind of criticism (and thus responsibility) and are quick to throw you under the bus to avoid a blemish on their case for promotion. Senior managers (who would become partners with a promotion) were the worse, in my experience. As a new employee, they were the least helpful and the most cutthroat during my time here. even worse, they feign interest in your development and how you're doing on your project, and then talk about you behind your back as they blame you for whatever is going wrong on the project. I experienced this on every project I was on. it was a recurring theme with every senior manager on every project. Managers werent much better, as they are also on the path to promotion to Senior Manager and have zero patience or interest in fostering a healthy working environment for anyone ranked below them. 
There should be a big concern if this next batch of senior managers up for promotion become partners - I have only positive experiences with existing partners, and current Sr. Managers could cause a significant change to company culture given the utter lack of compassion and toxic ""get ahead at all costs"" mentality.",0,1

It’s made a lot of changes that claim to be “for your benefits” with a catch. The most recent change is the switch to “unlimited vacation”. This is really the punch in the face that made everyone angry. It’s a blatant robbery. The worst part is that the leadership made it sound “You asked, we listened” while literally no one asked for it. And they chose to do this just when people didn’t use vacation much this year and less than one year from the latest vacation policy change. EY Leadership these years is very hypocritical. Other than the vacation change, the performance review with LEAD has become very shady. You used to know if you’re rated 3/4/5, but the new LEAD system has no clear indication. It comes down to behind your back conversations. People with similar dashboards have different raises. Absolutely ridiculous.

-The Adelaide office is an offshore delivery centre, meaning all work that the main UK business doesn't want to do is sent here, can be extremely tedious and monotonous with very little skill development
-Managers will bully people out and encourage them to leave, never experienced something so unprofessional in my entire life
-The firm claims to be 'mental health champions' and that you can always reach out, the reality is management couldn't care less
-Extremely low pay. By far the lowest in Belfast for similar work, multiple offers were turned down by candidates due to this, would recommend checking the salaries section in glassdoor for EY Belfast
-Management couldn't care less about alarming retention rate, 15 people left in 8 months out of a team of around 40 yet don't take action or address it 
-Flexi-working is advertised and was mentioned at interview several years ago but some managers would not let you work from home or operate on a more flexible schedule under any circumstances, this has now changed to some flexi-working being available after working there for 6 months (though obviously this has changed during covid-19)

-Seniors lack knowledge, lack vision, and completely lack sector understanding 
-Negotiate extremely well before joining. Dont worry, EY will hire you; because they need smart and hardworking people; You just need not put your foot down.
- Money is the only language here. Don't fall for caring words. Once you join; they will make sure that there is no increment for atleast a couple of years.
-Firm does not care about clients (forget employees). Its only Money.. Whether the project is fruitful for client, or whether the team is able to deliver; doesn't matter
-HR or employee policies are non-existent. 
-On top of everything, to remove transparency - buggers have eliminated rating system... so, however well you perform; you wont get any rating.. (seems good, but if you think about it - it's actually detrimental for high-performing people)

Depending on the project you're on, both your physical and mental health may be put in jeopardy unless you absolutely love the work you do. The ones who stay are the ones who live to work (and specifically this kind of work), rather than work to live. 
The marketing doesn't align with what actually happens. HR and Staffing Managers will say to speak up in case you're feeling overwhelmed, but when you do, you're met with the response indicated in this review's title. If it's a repeat project, you're forced to work on every iteration, no matter how much you speak up, since they think the carryover knowledge will help them save on budget.
It truly depends on the individuals you work with, so you're forced to hunt down people with reasonable work expectations (40-45 hours, 50-55 during busy season), but unfortunately, there aren't many here.
Due to competition among the Big 4, leadership will always take the ""bottom of the barrel"" engagements, that involve unreasonable client expectations for a heavily discounted fee.

I pointed out that there was no way we were going to make the deadline from day 1. The worst programming practices had been used for the project, and my co-workers barely seemed to have sufficient knowledge regarding the programming languages and frameworks used. The team lead often got offline at 3 PM and never gave clear instructions for the team. The project manager and other consultants left right before the project was about to blow up. The moment I finished the last bug in the backlog, I got a call from HR to say I was fired for bad performance.

I started applying for jobs, I was interviewed by companies that had worked on that specific project, they told me the environment was very political and they were aware the KPMG software engineering team was making bad decisions all the time. I was told I was the victim of a political fallout. I asked HR for an audit on the project which never happened. HR doesn't care whether you're actually performing good or bad. If someone wants you out you're gone, even if they're the ones at fault.

It couldn't get worse than this, KPMG tried to withhold all my salary until I gave them back the laptop and iPhone. But I was on vacation so I couldn't. I would have to wait almost 2-3 months for my salary to arrive. When I pointed out the article in the Luxembourg labor law, they suddenly complied.

After that they were still refusing to issue me my certificates necessary to apply for unemployment benefits.

After doing interviews for EY, Deloitte and PwC, KPMG is clearly behind its competitors in Luxembourg.

Don't lie about benefits, staff is not eligible for health insurance first 2 years of employment, and they're not eligible for pension plans the first 8 years of employment, yet it's marketed as if you're getting it from day 1. You'll also get a worn out iPhone as a 'benefit' as well as a company laptop you cannot use for personal use, which was also listed as a benefit.

Don't move to Luxembourg for KPMG if you value your career. I looked for work after being fired for 1 month and a half without success. I moved back abroad to a country where I don't speak the native language and found another job from my first interview.",0,1

You almost know everybody in your audit department group. Everyone is friendly there and as such there is no negativity with regards to working with your peers.","Working late nights is the norm here. If you are not working beyond 8pm that means you are not working seriously.
One of the major default in their working is that audit staff has IT admin passwords which they use to change time and date to allow audit documentation beyond deadlines. I haven't encountered any such instance but anyone can heavily misuse the password to bring down the entire KPMG network with it. Everyone in the audit from associate/ article trainee to the partner knows about sharing of IT admin password and they don't care

There is NO clean desk policy. They have a policy but just in papers. You can see audit and tax files lying all around office. If one wants to intentionally seek out any information regarding public companies, it is quite easy, just grab any file in the office lying around and 4 out of 10 times you may come across information about a public company.

- Variety of projects
- Good place to start your career (only from an experience perspective)","This review is for KPMG in Singapore, Advisory.

Where do I even begin? I would advise against reading any one-liner reviews you see on sites like Glassdoor. 

1. REMUNERATION AND STAFF RETENTION

It is a no-brainer that Big 4 pays below market especially for fresh graduates but you have no idea how appalling it can be for KPMG in Singapore. The Advisory pay structure is practically Audit pay structure with minor adjustments (Disclaimer: Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of very intelligent, friendly, nice, people in Audit but the value of Audit work in general cannot be compared to Advisory work, even though Audit revenues are generally steadier and less volatile than Advisory).

Hence, standard practice is to accept job offers here as a safety net, and then renege when you get better offers elsewhere. Even after starting work, juniors continuously apply to test the market for better offers. I know people who quit on the first day, after two weeks, within two months, within a year: so really, any time.

So junior turnover is extremely high. And you can imagine the burden this has on engagement delivery: juniors quit, teams have to re-hire, and then re-train the new hire. But while managers are training the new person, it means they have to help out on the grunt work themselves on top of the massive responsibilities they have as managers on admin, compliance, client management, etc. Eventually these managers themselves also quit.

It's a house of cards, really. How bad is the situation? In the Consulting arm of Advisory, some teams only have 1 to 3 juniors remaining (people who are Assistant Managers and below). Many people, especially juniors, left during and after an incredibly disappointing series of townhalls. First, people were promoted without a pay increase. Later, a pay increase was instituted for half a year, and only at half the amount of standard increments (i.e. half increment for half a year). No back-payment was promised. Can you imagine the disappointment? Yes, COVID made it difficult. But imagine a firm that cannot afford you a pay more despite already paying you so much lower than market average.

So I don't get why it is so difficult for management to understand the need to pay their staff better. It's even funnier when you discover some partners apparently believe that they pay above market. Their source? ""A recruiter told me."" The recruiter either has something against KPMG or is making you believe it in the hopes that this will indirectly cause unhappiness for some of your employees eventually, in turn making it easy for recruiters to target.

When my peers and juniors have become jaded at this company, I encourage them to look for jobs. I even know of people in other teams who forward job postings to their fellow teammates (manager to associate, for example). This is the toxic environment this firm has become although we have no malicious intent. We just want to support our colleagues who have become our friends.

2. JUNIOR PARTNERS HAVE A TOUGH LIFE TOO

When I say management, I really mean only senior partners and above. Junior partners and below have a terrible life. Junior partners find themselves trapped between resolving their team's problems and the need to avoid getting on the bad side of the more senior partners who are important to their career prospects (e.g. relationships with key accounts, relationships with industry, relationships within the broader global KPMG network).

When someone quits, junior partners ask ""How can I make your life better?"", and if the answer is ""Pay me higher"", they can only respond ""Sorry, even I can't do that for you.""",1,3

Security and stability a large firm brings
Starting to clear out the sub par male, pale, stale leadership","Pay is awful
Bonus is embarrassing 
L&D opportunities aren’t there - unless you want to do CIMA or ACA there’s no chance of anything meaningful, no masters sponsorship etc
This is no exaggeration, five - ten years behind on the digital agenda. Utterly clueless
Fragmented - partners scrapping for revenue and status. 
Partners are generally nothing special, very few intellectual powerhouses in the firm, mostly sales focussed individuals that were fortuitously aligned to a big-revenue client earlier in their career 
Some partners genuinely view the world in terms of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ - it would be cringe if it wasn’t so toxic 
Politics are unbearable 
If a partner takes a dislike to you, you may as well resign, seen many careers ruined
Promotions are a joke - there are people who are performing for 1 yr + at the grade above and still cannot get promoted. There have been people selling a lot of work that still get turned down
When you do go for promotion you are put through an interview process and have to provide a business case at even Manager level (something you literally cannot control, given it depends on the work you are aligned to)
Systems are so outdated and lead to a ton of admin
Very much a conform or leave agenda in terms of culture
D&I initiatives more oriented towards protecting partners from embarrassing headlines than actually addressing D&I issues - there have been no substantial policy changes in recruitment for example. 
The consulting practice is basically an advisory firm - generalists do not progress. If you want to progress you need to specialise in a certain, very specific area, which kind of defeats the reason why many people go into consulting in the first place. 
Quality of work is painfully variable - I’ve seen some work that can rival MBB and other work that is so poor I’m almost embarrassed for the client receiving it",1,3

I belong to their Management Consulting (MC) wing. The Management there is corrupt to the core, which was evident by the removal of a Director and few Managers from the team, when they were expelled from the company on account of taking bribes to get in some of their disciples into the firm. Someone from their own clan disclosed this and on a December winter, few of those chaps were caught off guard. And off they went out from the firm, Poof!!!

After that, a good for nothing Senior Manager, who didn't had any experience in handling a large team was made the head of the team and obviously, in his tenure the number of projects dwindled and almost all of them went to pipeline. The upper management woke up from their sleep and recruited a new Senior Manager after this. This new guy has come from another service based firm, which is notorious for regionalism and favouritism, and sure enough he had started the same behaviour in KGS too. That was evident from the team structure now, as most of the 'top performers' according to him, was from the same region from which he belongs. Obviously good and talented team members are avert to this, and they started either changing the team or left KGS altogether. This is the current stage of the KGS MC team, and I won't recommend any one to join it, unless you are good in buttering up the Managers. HR, as usual, are not conducive of the employees, but of the upper Management and you will be threatened to be put in Performance Improvement Plan, even if you are performing well. The new senior manager also pressurize the immediate managers to ask for the long tenured employees to leave the organization by setting them unachievable targets. If you have buttered him up and haven’t achieved your targets, that's not a problem. But for the others who genuinely work and who don’t know buttering up, like me, its a hell hole. I am still stuck here, and will be out of this hell as soon as I see something cooking up for me outside.",1,3

The office building from the outside.
One year counts as two ( but read the cons to understand why )","The office building from the inside. It reminds me of a nest of cockroaches, so many people so little space. They really care about their status but do not think about the conditions they put people in. For example, they could afford a bigger and more modern office a little bit further for the same price, but they stay in this mole pit because they want people to be impressed because the location in the center of the city is more important for them than the space for the employees. 
The corporate culture is crippled by the people turnover, managers and senior consultants understand they quite a few can indulge such conditions so they do not care about positive attitude or creating a healthy atmosphere. They always try to see the negative, scheme and plot, focus only on bad sides. The first week I worked there a n employeee tried to set me up and make a joke in fornt of a partner (thank good he was not clever nor schrewd ) I understood and stopped him.

This organization is a sales, management, and relationship company above all. They are not the best at what they do (despite the polished constant stream of fluff internal and external marketing). They rely pretty much entirely on their pre-existing financial assurance relationships to sell more work. Lots of opportunity to work in a wide variety of areas and industries so long as you keep active in your relationship building. Pretty easy business case to train and grow. Be decisive and stay committed to your intended career direction, and try not to be too flexible or you'll get easily lost. Speak up and be real about what you want - the coaching culture and support was amazing and will pleasantly surprise you if you pick your relationships right. Get what you need (training, relationships, exposure) and get out (unless you want to make partner). Lots of free and excellent training opportunities. Good parties for the young ones (pre-COVID). Pick your team wisely.","Hit and miss opportunities. Often you don't get to pick what you want to do, so you have to be OK with floating in the wind; subject to the whims of whatever client gets snagged in the marketing snares. Org structure makes things ridiculous - you'll probably report to 20 managers at some point who seem to make an active point of not talking to each other to actually resource manage (despite the titles). You will work long hours because of this ineffective management style. Very top heavy and political once you see through the fluff marketing. Meetings are nearly all day past a certain point, leaving barely any room to get any actual work done. The company does NOT value actual work (only sales and profits) and WILL treat you like a cog to be exploited as much as possible to a fault. The company is not as clever as they think they are in terms of its exploitative nature, and a complete inability to retain good people that actually get work done will be its eventual downfall. Peter principle reigns. HR is virtually non-existent. Titles are laughable - directors will have one or two managers reporting to them, each of which is most likely a glorified project manager and will be lucky to have any staff reports at all (despite external appearances). 

So brain-washy it isn't even funny. If you start your career here you won't even know the difference (by design). Don't get caught up and be very mindful of any non-chargable ""make work"" admin overhead company initiatives. They are 99.9% ploys by a director or partner to make them look good on the back of your personal ""voluntold"" time. Exploitation and team building on their own don't work when the entire company is doing it to each other, so there's nobody left to actually do the work. Que more overtime.",0,5

Those are the good ones.","If you’re a fresh graduate thinking that you’ve landed a prestigious job at a Big 4 firm, think again. Your starting pay of 3.0k is subject to around a 1.2 months bonus. Meanwhile all your peers with a GPA comparable or even below yours are earning 4-5k. Market rate. I’ve since landed jobs that pay 4.5 and above after staying in pwc for barely half a year. There is no such coaching culture as they like to preach, once you’re dumped in right after the 2 week inadequate zoom training, you’re expected to be as a good as a second year associate. Less than 3 in 10 people in the firm would actually explain anything to you, yet you’ll get scolded and marked down whenever you cannot explain the nature behind certain accounting documentation and testing. 

There is no welfare, during peak which lasts around 3-6 months (depending on which firms u r “lucky” enough to be assigned to audit), you are expected to work beyond 996. More like 9am- 12 midnight, you won’t get to spend time with you family and friends except (maybe)Friday night. 

There is a Roundtable every May or so, where the managers will have a meeting and faces of every associate and senior associate in the department will be flashed on a screen and be criticised and evaluated whether they should be promoted. This is stab in the back sort of politics. So if you’re lucky, your 3.0k pay might be upgraded to 3.3k if you do manage to promote. Hearsay 5 people did not promote last year due to this and COVID. So kenna 3.0k one more round while all your peers from other industries gunning for high 4 to Low 5s already. 

They conduct such stringent interviews, but the truth is the attrition rate is mortifying. During the week I left, I checked through others leaving as well because you can do so on the GTS booking on their Google calendar under “off boarding”. Every week since Jan, they would be like 10-15 people leaving on a Friday. People don’t even want their bonus in June because working for this firm is worse than the measly 40k we get a year.

Here is what happened when I worked for them in South America:

-They treated outsourced employees as their slaves.
-Paid below poverty line wages (my salary was 4 thousand dollars A YEAR. I was basically a volunteer that worked 9 hrs per day for them).
-Coworkers that didn't have privileged families were malnourished and didn't have enough money to pay for water & electricity, therefore they wouldn't shower to go to work.
-People work in offices full of rats. 
-We didn't have any windows, the offices were literally bunkers.
-You weren't allowed to go to the bathroom.
-You got tracked & monitored all day long, second by second. If you stopped working for one minute they would threaten you.
-Completely unrealistic deadline expectations that no human being could tolerate.
-You got sexually and psychologically harassed, especially as a woman.

I saw so many cases of harassment and suicide attempts in their Latin American offices. It was completely insane to work for such an unethical company as PricewaterhouseCoopers US (Tampa).

They also make you sign huge confidentiality agreements because everything they do abroad goes against onshore and offshore laws, their employer branding and corporate values. PwC is a company made in hell and everyone should be aware of that before choosing to work for them.

Quite ironically, they are actually hiring sons & daughters of diplomats and officials of human rights organisations that of course, speak native English. How else do you think they speak so well, PwC? Since they are global citizens, they are ten times more educated than the people that exploit them in their United States offices...this world is straight up turned upside down. I don't know how such horrible and uneducated people can have so much power. You should be ashamed of all your violations.

*This review has nothing to do with the company that outsources: all of the violations came from PwC's commands and insistence of creating horrible work conditions that would be unacceptable in the United States. If they did this in their own country, they would all be put in jail.",0,1

2. Great reality check on getting used to the number of hours people work in accounting/finance as you’ll be working 9-3am at least a few times a year (which is normal even on the client side). It’s just the nature of this actg field. 
3. Culture is great. Everyone is on board with the millennial corporate culture. No one will ever embarrass you or others for being bad at your job. Overall, everyone is very nice and willing to help. Even if they truly don’t want to help, everyone is obligated to help because it’s just the culture at this firm. 
4. Flexibility - the transfer process is super easy if you know the right people. I’ve been able to work in different service lines as a result. 
5. Promotion is pretty much guaranteed and timeline based. You put in the number of years and you’ll get it. You wouldn’t be held back from a promotion unless people absolutely hate you or you’re so bad at the job that you literally can’t be promoted. From what I’ve seen, you can be average and still get promoted even at the manager level. It’s all a seniority game at the end of the day.","1. The firm constantly tries to adopt new changes which creates inefficiencies and zero value add. It all seems more for marketing purposes than for actual enhancements to the day to day job. 
2. Too many firm initiatives that are just for show rather than practice. For example, “be well work well, stop the grind” slogan has been tossed around the firm for the last year or so but I haven’t seen anyone actually “stop the grind.” People are consistently working every minute of the day and will get pings during their vacation time. It’s just the nature of the job as this is a client service field. 
3. I don’t think the work necessarily translates well into industry as this is a client service field where companies come here to buy specific services that they do not want to do or have enough human bodies to crank out. The longer you stay the harder it will be to exit this field unless you’re set you want to be here for 10+ years (which might not be bad).",0,3

- Good benefits package.","- So siloed, hierarchical, and automated that it's impossible sometimes to find a solution to a problem. Higher level employees act like stingy gatekeepers of information and will even block you from achieving your goals if they feel threatened. 
- Constant IT issues that can take months to resolve.
- Casual sexism still rampant. If you are a woman, especially a minority woman, expect your ideas and work to be stolen and used by a peer or manager. If you have technical knowledge and expertise, it will be ignored because you don't look the part (male). 
- Very few growth opportunities for IFS. You will be expected to stay in your box. If any growth is discussed, it will be a strict line within your group. (So for example, if you're an admin but learned how to write Python, you still won't be encouraged to find a role outside of admin or, rarely, admin-management.) Bias comes into play here as well. Men in lower-level roles seem to be encouraged to branch out more than women are.
- Class and role bias very prevalent. You're judged by your title and not by what you can do. Higher level employees can be very abusive and they are rarely punished.
- The way bonuses and raises are distributed causes people to be very competitive, insecure, and scheming. Some behave unethically. 
-Leadership keeps critical information secret and feeds us untrue, carefully crafted lines to keep us complacent. 
- The firm values are virtue signalling, not of actual importance to the firm.
- Very ""do as I say, not as I do.""
- No mentoring system.
- Partners vote against their own interests and then complain and abuse employees when the changes they voted for take place.",1,1

They boast about open and friendly work culture, but in reality, the culture is intimidating. They claim that you can even walk into a partners/ directors cabin and express your concerns, but try doing it, I'm sure, you will be screwed by your manager. 
2) This office has no much famous clients (spare a few); majority of the clients are foreign/ multinational clients - They will hire you for India Practice and make you do the shared service for foreign counterparts - It is better to join the service delivery centre where you will atleast be paid more. 
3) Dirty tricks and gimmicks will be played by people around - The person acting as the field in charge will cover up all his/ her faults and miscommunications by shifting the entire blame on the people who would have joined new in the team. The manager will believe everything what the field in charge says for face value without even cross checking the facts/ hearing the other side. If the field in charge hates you due to any reason (even personal reasons, which happens quiet often), your life in the office will be miserable.
4) Due to difference of opinion with the manager/ field in charge, if you try to ask for a team change, there are managers who calls the person concerned and threatens them that they will malign their name in the other team as well.
5) If you complain about the misdeeds of the manager / field in charge to the group in charge, the group in charge will say some buttering words to you. At the same time, they will not take any action (they may even promote the concerned manager!!)
6) The interns get better work than qualified professionals - The interns get plethora of opportunities to do the audits of listed clients, SOX compliance, quarterly review, manufacturing clients, even chances for direct interaction with the CFO of the client - On the other hand, qualified professionals will be made to do vouching, reconciliation, taking printouts, ordering tea and snacks, collecting the food delivery!! The qualified will not even get the chance for direct interaction/ meeting with the important people since the manager considers them ""aliens who have no civilization""
7) There are even instances where the manager makes some interns (article trainees) to review the work performed by others, since the manager has no time - Undoubtedly, the quality of work is beyond pathetic.
8) Nobody will help you/ clear any of your doubts - If you ask doubt, they will even embarass you.
9) Some managers dont even know the basics of debits and credits or Company Law/ Income Tax Act. If you are good in arguing with the clients and bringing more revenue to the firm, your job is secure here - Technical skills are given least priority in promotions!
10) People are very conservative and too much groupism based on whether you are a North Indian or South Indian.
11) Unprofessional humiliation by the manager when sitting for review of work with the manager. The manager will be very professional and sweet to interns/ articles while reviewing the work - If you are a qualified person, you will be humiliated for no reason (eg: the font is not uniform, font colour is wrong etc).
12) Zero work life balance - Even below zero!

2) Few good firm initiatives like pens down day (option to take off on a week day), combo off days, thank you bonus etc","1) Too much favouritism and politics - practice of targeting an employee and screwing them is common.
2) Not able to utilise the benefits conferred by firm initiatives - Eg: Manager compels to work on a pens down day without allowing to take off, no compensatory off days allowed for the weekends/ holidays worked ( despite clear communication from the partnership that managers should allow team to take compensatory off)
3. Manager disturbs during odd hours at night ( after 11pm! even on saturdays and sundays) asking the status of work/ shouting at the team for meeting unnatural targets. This practice has become almost an everyday routine ever since work from home started.
4. If one single senior person in the team hates a person ( even if some personal grudge) , that persons name will be maligned infront of the whole team - too much backtalking and unprofessionalism.
5. Too much conservative people around
6. Worst cafetaria
7. No much prestigious clients - the firm survives mainly by undertaking shared service engagements from pwc counterparts abroad.
8. Forget weekends! Even to take half day off on a weekend, you need the mercy of your manager and convince him why you need half day off on a weekend.!

In fact, prior to joining PwC, I didn’t think it could get much worse than my last job. But, as PwC constantly reminds us, they do like to “Reimagine the Possible”. And they’ve certainly done that.

Starting a new job during a pandemic was never going to be easy, and in part, I’m sure some of the issues I have experienced may be attributable to that. But, pandemic or not, the standard of training and support that I, and others, have received, has been nothing short of disgraceful. 

Thrown into client work for the first time during the company’s busy season, we were often left to fend for ourselves, expected to complete complex documents with little or no guidance and to unbelievably short deadlines. And if, on some rare occasion, someone did think to reach out to offer help, it was often at their own expense, adding yet more stress to their already impossible workload. Here, credit must be given to the few truly wonderful people at PwC who do care about the welfare of others, knowing - often from personal experience - just how little support is given. It was this, more than anything, that first made me realise that PwC’s problems are not born of the pandemic; they are endemic, and likely have been for some time. 

The PwC grad scheme also offers you the chance to sit accountancy exams. And while, on the face of it, this might seem like a great opportunity to have your employer pay for you to obtain a much sought-after certification, the exam seasons I have endured so far have verged on the edge of torture. 

PwC offers the bare minimum in terms of study leave. In fact, despite the fact that the exams are a requirement of the job, they actually give them very little consideration. Pre-course work must be done on your own time. During busy season, this means working late into the night during the week (after an 11- or 12-hour day) and often at the weekend. On top of that, many of my peers, myself included, have even been forced to use all our limited holidays to have even a hope of passing. 

During the 4 or 5 weeks of classes, you have no option but to revise every waking hour of the day. And the sad reality is that, even then, your chances of passing are slim. The resources ICAS provide are poor in quality, riddled with errors, and the exercises often don’t match the content of the notes. The standard of teaching is mixed, with some clearly experienced tutors, and some who visibly struggle to comprehend the content they profess to teach. And while I understand that everyone has to start somewhere, their inexperience may be about to cost several people their jobs.

Now you might be wondering if upper management are aware of what’s going on. Has anyone thought to speak out, let someone know what’s happening? Yes. Time and again, we have called meetings with seniors and representatives who claim to have our best interests at heart, who claim to care about our mental health and well-being. I have sat in meetings where my strung-out, exhausted colleagues have recounted their experiences through tears. In many cases, they haven’t slept well in weeks, can barely find time to eat, and are generally struggling to cope. Time and again we have told ourselves “Surely, something has to be done now!”. But no. Each time, we are met with reassurances that our concerns will be raised with senior management. And, in fairness, maybe they are. But ultimately, it always comes to nothing. 

In all my life, I don’t think I’ve ever worked with a more burnt out, run down, and generally miserable group of colleagues. And if there was ever a more damning piece of evidence that PwC is failing its employees, it’s that those that have been fired for failing exams (and I have known more than a few) were not devastated or disappointed, nor even remotely perturbed. They were grateful.

You might think that I’m writing this in the hope that PwC will see it and care enough to do something. But in the year that I’ve been here, PwC have demonstrated, time and time again, that they do not care. No. I am writing this in the hope that somewhere out there, someone who has just received a very tempting offer letter from PwC might read this, and think twice before accepting.",1,1
